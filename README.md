# NeosDisableGamepads

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [NeosDisableGamepads.dll](https://github.com/Lexevolution/NeosDisableGamepads/releases/latest/download/NeosDisableGamepads.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
